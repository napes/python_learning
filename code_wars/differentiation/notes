examples:

differenatiate("12x+2", 3)      ==>   returns 12
differenatiate("x^2+3x+2", 3)   ==>   returns 9

2x+3

point is value to use for x in evaluation

2 step process:
    1) differentiate
    2) plug in x and evaluate


assumptions not in the docs:
    1) only addition and subtraction
    2) only using variable x

eval() will evaluate python within itself

in python 2x doesnt evaluate, but 2*x does

for evaluation: 2x -> 2*x; x^2 -> x**2
